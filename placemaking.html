            <h2>Why I love New England:</h2>
			<p>Having lived in the South for most of my life, I much prefer the directness, efficiency, and pragmatism of New England culture. People tend to be more self-reliant and less nosy. They mind their own business, respect the privacy of others, and are usually unoffended by those who look or behave differently.</p>
			<p>It’s been said that New Englanders are unfriendly, but I’ve actually found them to be quite kind (friendliness and kindness are of course not the same). Strangers will lend a hand to someone in need, for example, but all the while refer to the recipient as an asshole for not being better prepared.</p>
			<p>The four seasons are intensely distinct, more so than other places I’ve lived. Fall is of course my favorite because of the foliage. Places like Kancamagus Highway (or even just outside my window) are great for leaf peeping. Despite the occasional snowstorm, the weather really isn’t that bad. There are relatively few natural disasters - earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, tsunamis, and volcanoes aren’t a pervasive threat.</p>
			<p>I’d bet that 50 years from now, New England will be one of the few places still above water and not completely on fire. We’re uniquely suited as one of the few regions in America that might actually benefit from a warming climate. Though sensible as always, New England has been an early adopter of renewable energy and remains a leader in climate action with its small carbon footprint relative to other regions. The Northeast Corridor comes to mind as one such example. It’s perhaps Amtrak’s only functional line, and its Acela offering is the only high-speed electric rail option in the entire country.</p>
			<p>New England also values agriculture and local food production, especially through co-ops, CSAs, and farmers markets. Drive a few miles down any backroad, and there are plenty of farm stands, fruit orchards, micro-breweries, maple sugarhouses, and ice creameries to be found. Though for something a bit more convenient, there’s always a Dunkin (sometimes two) on every corner.</p>
			<p>From the Freedom Trail in Boston to small sites like the Concord Gasholder, there’s also no shortage of rich history to explore. Coupling this with Ivy League colleges and other prestigious universities has produced one of the most highly educated regions in the United States.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Why I love New Hampshire:</h2>
			<p>New Hampshire is a fascinating place, sometimes a bit ornery toward its neighboring states. It’s known for its political diversity, unlike other communities which can be echo chambers of homogenous thought. People tend to be more informed and politically active here, especially around the first-in-the-nation primary. This also makes it a great place to shake hands with just about any famous politician.</p>
			<p>The New Hampshire House is one of the largest democratic bodies in the world, with each legislator representing an average of only 3,300 constituents. Bureaucracy is of course still tempered by our “live free or die” spirit, which promotes many personal freedoms. There’s no sales or income tax, for example, though we certainly do pay for it in other ways.</p>
			<p>Statistically, New Hampshire is one of the safest states to live in. Crime rates are low, and it’s consistently one of the least likely places to die by gun homicide in the United States.</p>
			<p>The great outdoors are easily accessible throughout the state, especially in the White Mountains. But unlike out west, there’s less pretension and gatekeeping associated with nature. The stars are easily visible at night, particularly north of the Notches where light pollution is non-existent. Aside from leaf-peepers and holiday travel, there’s usually not much traffic.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Why I love Concord:</h2>
			<p>As a micropolis (meaning less than 50k people), Concord has a small town feel, yet all the cultural amenities of a larger city. Main Street is home to many small businesses, and the local economy thrives with an active chamber of commerce. Community events like the Multicultural Festival, Market Days, and Winter Fest bring people together. Most happenings are within walking distance, though downtown’s parking garages are clean, cheap, and convenient.</p>
			<p>There’s no shortage of performing arts venues, including the Capital Center for the Arts, the Bank of New Hampshire Stage, Hatbox Theatre, and the Audi. Many shows are free or have been funded by the century-old estates of generous residents. Other cherished institutions include Kimball Jenkins (fine art), Red River Theatre (cinema), Gibson’s (independent bookstore), and Concord Community Music School (classical performances).</p>
			<p>As the state capital, Concord is a lively community where people care about the things happening around them. The Concord Monitor sustains a local readership, and city council meetings are always well-attended. The Statehouse is also easily accessible, which often invites protests, dialogue, and other features of a healthy democracy.</p>
			<p>There’s plenty to see and do, including 81 miles of public trails that intersect with municipal parks and greenspaces. But in the event of boredom, Concord’s central location is within just 90 minutes of Boston, the Seacoast, or the White Mountains; and only 2-3 hours to Portland, Burlington, Cape Cod, or Canada.</p>
